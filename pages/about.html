    <span id="hi-im-adrian">hi, i'm adrian</span><br>
    video games have always been a huge part of my life, shaping my interests and how i see the world. they're not just games to me, they're fully immersive experiences that let me step into another reality, and i love taking the time to soak it all in.
    <br><br>
    besides gaming, i have a strong interest in photography and cinematography, and bringing these together eventually led me to virtual photography. it's a way to capture beautiful and cinematic moments from the games i love, and to create my own stories through each shot. it's how i show these games through my own perspective and style.
    <br><br>
    so here i am, sharing my journey with you. the virtual photography community is amazing, and i love contributing to it. i also hope to help people discover what can be created with just a game and a bit of creativity. i'm still new to it though, so i'm always seeking inspiration and ways to improve, creating shots that feel more and more satisfying for me and hopefully catch more eyes.
    <br><br>
    in the future, i plan to use this site for more than just virtual photography. i want it to be a cozy, relaxed space where i can share my projects in any form they take. the site itself has been as much of an experiment as my other projects and hobbies.
    <br><br>
    you can also check out the pages below to learn more about me, virtual photography, and other creative inspirations. and if you'd like to connect, my socials and email are in the footer — enjoy exploring the site!

   <!-- about VP -->
   <div id="about-vp" style="display: none;">
        for me, everything started years ago. while exploring various video games, even multiplayer ones, i often took screenshots on Steam of cool scenery. sometimes, i didn’t even mind if the hud was visible; i just wanted to capture the beautiful compositions i came across. over time, i discovered games with dedicated photo modes and began exploring all the options they offered. i was impressed by the capabilities of these features, especially when they included elements similar to real photography cameras and lenses.
        <br><br>
        at some point, i stumbled upon a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/art_in_games">steam group dedicated to beautiful screenshots</a>, and i was instantly captivated by the creativity and skill of other people’s work. it motivated me to dive deeper, and i started finding people from there on twitter and joining communities like FRAMED. when i first visited the <a href="https://framedsc.com/HallOfFramed/">Hall of FRAMED</a>, i was blown away by what was possible. every picture felt like a piece of art. from there, i followed more creators and explored the main site, where i discovered numerous guides and third-party tools that revolutionized how people capture stunning in-game shots.
        <br><br>
        <p align="center"><a href="https://framedsc.com/HallOfFramed/" class="img-href vpbuttonclass2"><img src="/assets/hof.png" alt="Hall of FRAMED" class="nav-image-button center aboutvpimg"></a></p>
        at first, i was a bit discouraged by the paywalls for some tools. but as i followed more people on twitter, i learned about a FRAMED discord server. the idea intrigued me, but for a while, i hesitated to join because i felt my screenshots were too basic compared to the incredible work i saw online. eventually, though, i became motivated to improve. i reached out to one of the founders and asked about joining the server. i was eager to learn the techniques behind the shots i admired and improve my own skills. joining the community turned out to be the biggest step in this hobby for me. i met amazing people who shared tips and tools, but we also had casual, fun conversations beyond virtual photography.
        <br><br>
        being part of this community inspired me to purchase my first "pro" tools from <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/Otis_Inf/home">Otis_Inf's Patreon</a>. these tools were revolutionary - they allowed unprecedented control over the game, enabling me to capture stunning and highly detailed shots. this was when i began creating the shots that i now upload here on my blog.
        <br><br>
        nowadays, i take things slower, as i balance this hobby with other interests. however, whenever i find a fascinating game, i set aside time to capture its beauty. one aspect for me is that i separate my first playthrough of a game from the process of taking shots. using tools and capturing detailed images often requires changing the game’s settings, which aren’t always ideal for regular gameplay. so, i usually wait until i’ve finished a game before diving into virtual photography.
        <br><br>
        i’d love for more people to discover this hobby. even if they don’t participate directly, just following it can be incredibly inspiring. below, i’ve included some resources and recommendations i’ve gathered over time:
        <br><br>
        <b>getting started</b><br>
        if you’re interested in starting this hobby, i highly recommend visiting the <a href="https://framedsc.com/">FRAMED community website</a>. it’s packed with guides for specific games and universal tips that apply to almost any game. the explanations there are far more detailed than i could provide, and the site is an invaluable resource. the community is also open to everyone - you can find more information on their <a href="https://framedsc.com/joinus.htm">Join Us page</a>.
        <br><br>
        <p align="center"><a href="https://framedsc.com/" class="img-href vpbuttonclass2"><img src="/assets/framed.png" alt="FRAMED" class="nav-image-button center aboutvpimg"></a></p>
        <b>tools</b><br>
        the best tools, in my opinion, are those provided by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/Otis_Inf/home">Otis_Inf on his patreon page</a>. these include both game-specific tools and universal ones for games built on engines like Unreal Engine. the subscription costs only $6 per month, and you only need to renew it if you want access to new releases or updates required for game patches. once downloaded, the tools are yours to keep forever.

   <!-- movies -->
   <div id="movies" style="display: none;">
    i've always been fascinated by the art of filmmaking and have spent a lot of time studying and exploring cinematography, understanding how visuals and storytelling come together to create something unforgettable.
    <br><br>
    this has given me a deeper appreciation when watching movies and has also helped me develop a better way of discovering new films to enjoy.
    <br><br>
    if you're curious about what i watch, you can check out <a href="https://letterboxd.com/Adrian28/">my Letterboxd profile</a>, where i keep track of all my movies!

   <!-- music -->
   <div id="music" style="display: none;">
        <p>music is more than just something i enjoy - it's an experience. sometimes it feels like stepping into another world, crafted by my favorite songs, where melodies and lyrics come together and hit me in such a unique way. it's not just about listening, it's about feeling, like the music knows me, and i know it.
            <br><br>
            there's something powerful about the way a song can resonate so deeply, transporting me, calming me, or stirring emotions i didn't know were there. sometimes it even helps me with my tourette's (the more you know), quieting everything else for a little while. music isn't just sound to me, it's a really important part of who i am, and i know it might sound exaggerated or "generic," but that's truly how i feel about it.
            <br><br>
            besides that, it's a really good way to connect with someone else. knowing i have people and friends with whom i can share my songs and discovering they also really resonate with and enjoy them is like food for my soul. it helps me bond with people in a way that feels special.
            <br><br>
            over the past years, i've come across many songs that i've fallen in love with. for my most recent ones, i started creating some Spotify playlists that I love to share with anyone. i mostly enjoy listening to and discovering songs from any era or genre (with a few exceptions, of course, that i don't resonate with), but my main genres are Metal and Electronic.
            <br><br>
            one playlist i built with love recently is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ytOVKZZukEdri73V1M2X0?si=847875c7222f4b67">Let Me Rust</a>, containing hand-picked alternative metal songs that i discovered and that hit me really hard. i also have lots of other personal playlists on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/adriannn28?si=3a5a45624c904bf8">my Spotify profile</a>, so feel free to explore.
                        <p align="center"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ytOVKZZukEdri73V1M2X0?si=847875c7222f4b67" class="img-href vpbuttonclass"><img src="/assets/letmerust.png" alt="Let Me Rust spotify playlist" class="nav-image-button center"></a></p>
